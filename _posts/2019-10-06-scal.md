# Motivation/context
I'm interested in figuring out an ultra cheap way to transform my IKEA table to a touch screen or some sort of user interface. Figuring out the position of the table where a tap happens could achieve that. This is the problem of acoustic source localization. 

Normally to localize an acoustic source, one needs synchronous recordings from multiple channels. For the case of impulse excitations in particular (percussive excitations - something hitting the thing) it is easy to localize the source when one can simultaneously read multiple channels. One may simply compute a triangulation for the first time of arrival of the elastic wave. 

On the other hand, depending on the damping characteristics, it could be even  impossible to localize the source in a 2D plate if records from multiple sensors do not exist. In time-of-arrival methods, to the best of my knowledge reverberations on the boundaries are hard to model precicely and are treated as a nuisance in applications.

The "DIY" route to the absence of a proper nice multi-channel ADC, is buying a cheap FPGA and learning to program it. I have resisted this temptation because I know some very smart people that do program FPGAs and they attest to the difficulty of programming them. Might do that some day as well. Given that in general multi-track recording is expensive, and I'm quite bad at soldering, and I don't have the patience or time to source multiplexers etc, I thought of trying something else.

An aditional motivation for this project is that I'm working with DenseNets lately - which is a particular type of convolutional neural networks with shortcut connections from all layers to all layers, and I got some really good results for another problem. The results are too good to be true and experience states that there is some possibility they are not correct! So I wanted a controlled non-trivial dataset to test a DenseNet with an architecture similar to the one I'm using for the other problem. 

## The math background
There is a theory called **compressive sensing** that states that when we have a signal that consists of some components, mixed in an unknown way,
 we can fully recover it if we sample in a smart way, and beat classical bounds on sampling frequency (Nyquist frequency) for fully recovering the signal.
Namely, the trick is to replace regular sampling with randomized sampling. One important consequence of this 
theory is that if you get a scalar signal that consists of signals of some sensors, that have been multiplied and shifted 
in any way that is different for each sensor, you can fully recover and separate the original signals. 
There should be a connection with non-linear ICA here to be made.
This used to surprise me since it is quite counter-intuitive! Now when I think of this, the idea is quite intuitive. 
The simplest example of compressive sensing that comes to my mind, is related to the simplest construction of an  invertible matrix. 
Namely, an invertible matrix can be created by simply filling a matrix with random values. It's *extremely* unlikely that you get a non-invertible random matrix if you don't impose some more structure. We impose such a structure with regular sampling! We can destroy it by non-regular sampling! Anyway, not sure how accurate is my understanding, but I'm quite convinced that compressive sensing makes sense and regular sampling has few good things to offer.

## Elastodynamics of plates, and a simple compressive electric circuit:
How does compressive sensing come into play when finding the excited eigenmodes of a structure? 
It is easier to think of a string:

![harmonics](/img/guitarharm.jpg)

Say we want to get the precise reconstruction of the vibration of a string.
 And we have 3 sensors. If the string is excited in its 3rd harmonic and 
we place the sensors on the nodes of the 3rd harmonic (the places that there 
is no displacement when the harmonic is excited) we will be able to sense nothing!
 Note also that all multiples of the 3rd harmonic are lost (for example the 
nodes of the 6th harmonic are also nodes of the 3rd harmonic). If we randomly 
place the sensors on the string, it is extremely unlikely that they will end 
up all on nodes of harmonics so we'll always sense a mixture of modes! 
And of course an arbitrary excitation is going to be a mixture of several harmonics.

For a related reason, square or generally symmetric rooms are bad for listening
 to music or playing music. There are "modes" of the air in the room that are not 
well excited and others that are over excited, and the audience can't listen correctly 
to the overtones of the instrument (audience hears "the room" as well in some sense).

In two dimensions, a similar situation arises. Random sensor placement is optimal 
sensor placement in a certain sense! It is most probable to get incoherent measurements if 
you use randomly placed sensors. If one places sensors in a symmetric manner on 
a symmetric structure it is highly likely that information will be lost or not
retrieved in an optimal manner.

## The actual single-channel 2D impulse locator:
My purpose is not, and never was, to fully reconstruct the signal from multiple sensors!
I need some simple **integrating** hardware that returns a 1D representation of the signal 
from all the sensors, which is expected to be unique depending on the dynamics excited by the "tap". 
The elasto dynamics of a plate, together with the dynamics of electrical charges on a circuit could achieve that.
I just need an algorithm that can automatically identify the signal and use the signal for localization, learning features directly from data.
By integrating, I mean that I want my signal from all sensors to somehow affect the 1D signal in 
a non-trivial way that I can potentially exploit in a downstream task.
The simplest integrator I can think of is an analogue integrator - i.e. a capacitor! 
My sensor of choice is piezoelectric disks. Piezoelectric disks, are capacitors themselves so they are perfect for the application!
Therefore the compressive sensing circuit is the sensor itself! I am not aware of any other work that performed compressive 
measurements using analogue integrators - I think the focus is on digital random integrators and this is what I was thinking to do in the beginning. 
However, if I can do the same with an analogue integrator then the circuit becomes much simpler!

It should be noted that the piezos are not exactly passive. They do act as capacitors, which is a passive component, but they also
 create a charge when they are excited. This charge is either neutralized locally due to leakage in the piezo,
 or becomes current in a closed circuit connected to the capacitor. When we use piezos as sensors, we take 
advantage of the latter obviously. Finally, since piezo-disks are **transducers** they deform under charge. 
Piezos are often used as ultra-cheap speakers for appliances (if you have a home appliance that creates 
a high-pitched sound it probably uses a piezoelectric disk). Piezoelectric components are often 
used as active sensing components. One may use use them to excite your structure as well.
The most interesting application of that is the ultrasound. The ultrasound probe contains an array 
of piezoelectric components that send a high-pitched elastic signal (in the ultrasound range) 
and they sense it when it gets reflected. By some phasing tricks, the tomographic information of 
the underlying tissue is relatively easy to reconstruct with appropriate hardware. By the way, 
the idea of using compressive sensing for cheaper ultrasound machines has already been used!
 [Here is a link to this interesting research](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/12/e1701423). 

In my experiment, I have an acrylic plate with 3 piezoelectric sensors connected in series, supported with hot-glue (see picture). The sensors 
were connected in series because I want them to develop some recharging/uncharging dynamics in tandem with the dynamics of the plate. 
This would not be possible in parallel, since the charge would simply sink to the soundcard.
Note also that I purposely do not put them in regular positions. Also the support of the plate (the corks I hot-glued) are non-symmetric.
I tap the plate with a plastic pen and I record the mixed signal in a single channel. 
The signal is expected to be unique for each tap location due to the coupled elastodynamics and electrodynamics of the piezos.

With my ghetto weekend project, I only do 2D localization on a plate. Here is a bottom view of the plate.

And a top view, where I sketched a 5x8 grid

### Excitation
So with some patience, I managed to collect more than 2k taps on this plate... The trick is to transform the task into an as brainless and repetitive one as possible. So I tap the boxes in series from 0,0 to 4,7, always in the same order. I record in Audacity with 44khz sampling frequency. Finally I have a python script that identifies the peaks of the taps, and assigns them to the correct box by the order that the taps came. The are located around the peak of each tap. Namely 1k samples before the peak and 3k samples after the peak. 

After collecting the taps some first encouraging results with PCA were observed.
Namely, while plotting the distribution of the PCA components for each box, we see that there are some patterns emerging that indeed seem to fingerprint the excitation  position. 

![pca components](/img/pcacomps.png)

The different rows of each matrix plot correspond to different independent measurements. In my reading of the plot, 
PCA analysis captured some variations that have to do with the variation that I wanted to capture in the first place! Namely the 
localization info - whether there is something in the signal that is unique at each tap location due to the system dynamics. 
Equipped with this new knowledge, I proceeded to try training a predictive model. 

## DenseNet for localization
I used a simple DenseNet model with 5 layers of filters of size 10, with relus and dilations of size 2. I made a loss function that classified the x and y position separately (so I can have more "bits" of information entering my network). Almost to my surprise, the network performed really well from the first try! This was surprising for these reasons:
* This almost never happens
* I fed raw high-frequency audio signals - no FFT or wavelet processing (or featurizing) and no denoising.

Here are the confusion matrices on the whole set. I used a training set of around 2k samples and 500 samples as validation set, with sampling for validation set stratified by tap position (5x8 = 40 strata). Here are the confusion matrices for the whole dataset:
![confusion - x](/img/confx.png)
![confusion - y](/img/confy.png)

For some reason `matplotlib` does not want to plot my confusion matrix nicely. I gave up. Anyway, the results are good at least!

I tried it also with completely new examples and the accuracy is as good! I'm not entirely surprised this works - but I have to admit that I'm quite surprised this worked so easily!

## Conclusions
Compressive sensing theory lets you get information from multiple channels while only recording a single one, if the channels are mixed in an incoherent way.
What is different in this application is that instead of making incoherent measurements I make a sensing circuit that is incoherent with the measurement that I want to perform - namely it is excited in a unique way depending on where I excite it. It's difficult to model exactly how it is excited, but I don't really need to model exactly how it is excited to perform 2D localization. That's why I use deep learning to do that! Actually even it is not obvious from the results here, PCA gives quite decent results. I will also try an SVM with the PCA components - I'm pretty sure this will also work.

Deep neural networks can easily handle the task of figuring out useful features for acoustic localization. I am not sure if indeed I'm capturing the dynamics of the 3-sensor circuit or some excitation dependent reverberations. The later is still interesting and it still works due to the same theory!
Visually there were some discernible difference between the impulses, mostly on the low amplitude part of the wave.
 Now that I have all the machinery in place, I'm going to go bigger and transform my IKEA table to a "tap" screen! It would be amazing if it turns out this works with brushing sounds (then I would have a proper touch-screen).

Hope you liked it!
