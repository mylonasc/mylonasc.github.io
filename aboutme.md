My name is Charilaos (Harry) Mylonas, and I am a Phd candidate on the topic of Uncertainty Quantification for Remaining Useful Lifetime predictions on Wind Energy. 
I mainly use large-scale simulations and machine learning techniques to gain insight and quantitatively model structural and operational quantities of interest in wind turbines and wind farms.
My research is funded by the *ERC Starting Grant WINDMIL on the topic of  "Smart Monitoring, Inspection and Life-Cycle Assessment of Wind Turbines *. 

My hobies include guitar, photography and electronics/microcontrolers (and deep learning - but that's also sort of my work...)


### my history

After I finished my Civil engineering studies in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, mainly through exposure to finite elements, I found my true *"calling"* in Computational Science.
 This led me to Zurich, where I finished my MSc in **Computational Science and Engineering** at ETH, while also doing a brief internship in the banking sector as a software developer.
After that I worked as a research assistant in the Risk Safety and Uncertainty Quantification group at ETH (UQLab).
