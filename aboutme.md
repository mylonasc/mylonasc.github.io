My name is Charilaos (Harry) Mylonas, and I am a Phd candidate on the topic of Uncertainty Quantification for Remaining Useful Lifetime predictions on Wind Energy. 
I use large-scale simulations and machine learning techniques to gain insight and quantitatively model structural and operational quantities of interest in wind turbines and wind farms.
My research is funded by the *ERC Starting Grant WINDMIL on the topic of  "Smart Monitoring, Inspection and Life-Cycle Assessment of Wind Turbines *. 

My hobies include guitar, photography and electronics/microcontrolers.
