Welcome to my webpage. I am Charilaos (Harry) Mylonas, and I am a Ph.D. candidate on the topic of Machine Learning & Uncertainty Quantification for Remaining Useful Life Predictions in Wind Energy. I use and adapt machine learning to make the best out of large-scale simulations and historical monitoring data for wind turbines and wind farms.
I am passionate about progressing science and engineering with computing, and I am excited about applications of Deep Learning and Reinforcement learning for that purpose.

The main tools I use in my research are graph machine learning (Graph Neural Networks - in particular the message-passing variants), (variational) probabilistic deep learning (VAEs & normalizing flows, Neural Processes), and combinations thereof ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16049), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06791))

My hobbies include guitar playing, electronics/microcontrollers, and digital art.
