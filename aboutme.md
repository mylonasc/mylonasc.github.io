Welcome to my personal webpage. I am Charilaos (Harry) Mylonas, and I am a Phd candidate on the topic of Machine Learning & Uncertainty Quantification
 for Remaining Useful Life Predictions on Wind Energy. 
I use large-scale simulations and machine learning techniques to gain insight and quantitatively model structural and operational quantities of interest in wind turbines and wind farms.

My research is on deep generative models (in particular VAEs & normalizing flows), graph machine learning (GraphNets) and combinations thereof.
My application domains of interest are scientific computing, structural condition monitoring and remaining life assessment.
I am also interested on the prospects of AI on healthcare and solving real-world engineering and societal problems in general.

My hobbies include guitar playing, electronics/microcontrolers and digital art.
