title: About me
subtitle: Phd student/Computational Scientist
---

My name is Charilaos (Harry) Mylonas, and I am a Phd candidate on the topic of Uncertainty Quantification for Remaining Useful Lifetime predictions on Wind Energy. 
I use large-scale simulations and machine learning techniques to gain insight and quantitatively model structural and operational quantities of interest in wind turbines and wind farms.
My research is funded by the *ERC Starting Grant WINDMIL on the topic of  "Smart Monitoring, Inspection and Life-Cycle Assessment of Wind Turbines *. 

My hobies include guitar, photography and electronics/microcontrolers (and binge-reading papers and implementing deep learning ideas I find interesting - but that's also my work). 

### my history

After I finished my Civil engineering studies in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, mainly through exposure to finite elements, I found my true *"calling"* in Computational Science.
 This led me to Zurich, where I finished my MSc in **Computational Science and Engineering** at ETH, while also doing a brief internship as a full stack software developer.
Before starting my Ph.D. studies I also worked as a research assistant at ETH.
