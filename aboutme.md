subtitle: PhD Candidate and Computational Scientist

I am a [computational scientist](https://ethz.ch/en/studies/master/degree-programmes/engineering-sciences/computational-science-and-engineering.html), passionate about progressing science and engineering and solving real-world problems with machine learning and scientific computing.

I am currently doing my PhD on Machine Learning & Uncertainty Quantification for Remaining Useful Life Predictions in Wind Energy. I employ and extend machine learning to make the best out of large-scale simulations and historical monitoring data for wind turbines and wind farms.

In my research, I use graph machine learning (Graph Neural Networks - in particular, the message-passing variants) and probabilistic deep learning \[ [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16049)  [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06791) \]

My hobbies include electronics/microcontrollers and digital art.
